# PI2GO

Hello all, 

I'm attepting to get 3-4 PI2GO RaspiRobots to simulating swarm technology. The end goal is to have multiple robots communicate with each other. For example, I would like them to be able to travel around a room without crashing. Furthermore, I wish to program them to create various formations, such a square or a line.

This is a work in progress, and all my code is currently open to the public.
